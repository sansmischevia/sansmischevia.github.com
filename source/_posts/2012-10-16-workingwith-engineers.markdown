I’m currently 37,000 feet over Lake Michigan, on my way to New York. It's been an incredible ride this past year. On the 28th of October, it will mark the one-year anniversary of me leaving my cushy corporate job and embarking on a journey to staruplandia. Things have been going great, and our team has been growing. 

To help our new, non-tech hires onboard, I’ve written a quick one-pager-turned-three-pager about what it’s like to work with engineers, and how to work with engineers effectively. I hope people outside of Vungle can benefit from this as well.

__Note!__ These are my own, personal thoughts that I’ve accumulated after working for four Silicon Valley technology companies, purely in the software and mobile industry. I’ve been on both sides of the table – a pesky intern bugging my mentors for help, and a CTO where I can never answer enough questions. You may not agree with a lot of generalizations that I’m making, but hopefully you get the message.
